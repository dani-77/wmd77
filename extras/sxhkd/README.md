# sxhkd

Just in case you want to keybind a few more programs, I suggest sxhkd; 
it is a simple way to add a few keybinds and I prepared an example.

copy sxhkd dir to ~/.config/ as follows:

```
$ cp -r sxhkd ~/.config/
```

The startup script already has it running by default.


To adapt the file to your needs, edit ~/.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc to bind your things.
